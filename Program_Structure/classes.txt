Mesh (Abstract)(Association between Mesh and PIC):

Definition = Defines the type of mesh.
Attributes:
	+nPoints (int) = Number of points in the mesh.
	+volumes ([double]) = Volume of each node.
	+pic (PIC) = Object that provides pic methods (Association between Mesh and PIC).
Methods:
	+setDomain() = This function, with the values provided by the boundary files, will create the mesh, by setting up volumes, nPoints and any other subclass variable.
	+getPosition([int] i): [double, double y] = For a each index return its real position.
	+getIndex([double,double] pos): [double,double] = For each real position returns its index value. Important to remember that the number of columns may vary
           depending on the actual type of mesh subclass used.
#	+print() = Print a VTK file / Matplotlib visualization of the mesh (points and connections between nodes). Also print volumes.

Mesh_2D_rm (Inherits from Mesh):

#Definition = Mesh class for a 2D rectangular mesh. The organization of the points will work as 0<=i<nx and 0<=j<ny. Also, for k parameter 0<=k<nPoints, k = nx*j+i.
Attributes:
	+xmin (double) = Left limit of the domain (closest to the Sun).
	+xmax (double) = Right limit of the domain (farthest from the Sun).
	+ymin (double) = Bottom limit of the domain.
	+ymax (double) = Top limit of the domain.
	+depth (double) = Artificial thickness of the domain, to make it three-dimensional.
	+nx (int) = Number of nodes in the x direction.
	+ny (int) = Number of nodes in the y direction.
    +dx (float32) = Distance between adyacent horizontal nodes
    +dy (float32) = Distance between adyacent vertical nodes
	+Mesh class attributes.
Methods:
	+Implementation of Mesh methods.


PIC (Abstract)(Association between Mesh and PIC):

Definition = Indicate the methods that all PIC classes have to implement. Each PIC concrete class will depend on the type of mesh, as well as the type of PIC algorithm implemented.
Methods:
	+scatter([double, double] positions, [double] values, [double] field) = Receives the positions of the particles, and makes scatter procedure, calculating the values of field for each node.
	+gather([double, double] positions, [double] field): [double]field_p = Calculates values of the field in particles' positions, returning these values in an array as long as positions, called field_p.

PIC_2D_rm1o (Inherits from PIC):

Definition = PIC class for rm10 ('r'ectangular 'm'esh, '1'st 'o'rder implementation).
Methods:
	+Implementation of PIC class methods.
	+scatter_density = return densities of that species in every node of the mesh.
	+scatter_velocity = return velocities of that species in every node of the mesh.
	+scatter_flux = return flux of particles of that species into every indicated node (not all the mesh).

Species (Abstract):

Definition = This abstract class is the wrapper for everything related to particles. Any species of particles inherits from this class.
Attributes:
	+q (double) = charge of the species.
	+m (double) = mass of the species.
	+q_over_m (double) = q/m.
	+debye (double) = Debye length of the spcies.
	+spwt (int) = specific weight of the species.
	+max_n (int) = max. number of particles for the species.
	+mesh_values (Particles_In_Mesh) = object to store anything related with the particles in the mesh.
	+part_values (Particles) = oject to store anything related to the actual particles in physical space.

Proton (Inherits from Species):

Definition = Species that take care of protons.
Attributes:
	+type (string) = some string descriptor that indicate the type/source of protons.
	+Species attributes.

Electron (Inherits from Species):

Definition = Species that take care of electrons.
Attributes:
	+type (string) = some string descriptor that indicate the type/source of electrons.
	+Species attributes.

Ion (Inherits from Species):

Definition = Species that take care of ions.
Attributes:
	+type (string) = some string descriptor that indicate the type of ion.
	+Species attributes.

Neutral (Inherits from Species):

Definition = Species that take care of neutrals.
Attributes:
	+type (string) = some string descriptor that indicate the type of neutrals.
	+Species attributes.

Particles_In_Mesh (Abstract)(Composition with Species):

Definition = Store values of distributions in the mesh related with particles. It wraps all the attributes that all particles must have.
Attributes:
	+nPoints (int) = Number of nodes in the mesh (Same as mesh class).
	+density ([double]) = Density values at each node.
	+velocity ([double, double]) = Velocity at each node. Rows are different points, columns are (x,y,z) components if they are available.

Electrons_In_Mesh (Inherits from Particles_In_Mesh):

Definition = Actual implementation of Particles_In_Mesh for electrons.
Attributes:
	+flux_spacecraft ([double]) = Perpendicular flux density of electrons going in (+) or out (-) of the spacecraft. The number of rows is the number of points compounding the mesh,
									and each value represents the flux trough the line (area) next to the point (in ant-clockwise direction).
	+Particles_In_Mesh attributes.

Particles:

Definition = Stores values related with the particles themselves. (
