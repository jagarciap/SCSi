#       +Method that computes the electric potential for a 2D rectangular mesh using the method of
#       +Successive Over Relaxation with Chebyshev Acceleration (SORCA). The method assumes that the 
#       +boundaries has been treated previously and assumes a Dirichlet boundary, so it only calculates values
#       +for the inner nodes. If a Neumann condition is desired, then the outer layer nodes are calculated correspondingly 
#       +in the later method apply applyElectricBoundary(e_field), not here.
#       +Parameters:
#       +rhs ([double]) =  is the right-hand-side of the equation Poisson(\phi) = rhs.
#       +pot ([double]) = is the potential before being updated, or it can be seen as the first guess of the solution.
#       +err (duble) = is the maximum variation expected between succesives steps to reach solution. 
#       +step_limit (int) = a boundary in number of steps to avoid infinite loops.
