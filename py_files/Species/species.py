#Species (Abstract):
#
#Definition = This abstract class is the wrapper for everything related to particles. Any species of particles inherits from this class.
#Attributes:
#	+name (string) = some string descriptor that indicate the type/source of particles.
#       +dt (double) = timestep for the motion of the particle.
#	+q (double) = charge of the species.
#	+m (double) = mass of the species.
#	+q_over_m (double) = q/m.
#	+debye (double) = Debye length of the spcies.
#	+spwt (int) = specific weight of the species.
#       +pos_dim (int) = number of components of position
#       +vel_dim(int) = number of components of the velocity
#	+mesh_values (Particles_In_Mesh) = object to store anything related with the particles in the mesh.
#	+part_values (Particles) = oject to store anything related to the actual particles in physical space.
#Notes:
#       +__init__() receives nPoints from mesh
#       +saveVTK(Mesh mesh): dictionary = Return the attributes of the Species to be printed in the VTK file.
#           The process is handled through Particles_In_Mesh.
#       +loadVTK(Mesh mesh, output) = Takes information of the species from a VTK file through 'output' and stores it in the corresponding attributes.
#           The process is handled through Particles_In_Mesh.

#
#Definition = Store values of distributions in the mesh related with particles. It wraps all the attributes that all particles must have.
#Attributes:
#	+nPoints (int) = Number of nodes in the mesh (Same as mesh class).

#	+velocity ([double, double]) = Velocity at each node. Rows are different points, columns are (x,y,z) components if they are available.
#       +residuals([double]) = remnants from injection of particles at the previous step.
