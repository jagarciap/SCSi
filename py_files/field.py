#Methods:
#	+__init__(...) = This function, for each subclass, will take care of the initial condition of the field.
#	+computeField([Species] species) = Computes the updated field values.
#	+fieldAtParticles([double,double] position) [double,double] = return an array indicating by component (columns) and particles (rows) the field at every position.
