#
#Definition = This abstract class is the wrapper for everything related to particles. Any species of particles inherits from this class.
#Attributes:
#	+q (double) = charge of the species.
#	+m (double) = mass of the species.
#	+q_over_m (double) = q/m.
#	+debye (double) = Debye length of the spcies.
#	+spwt (int) = specific weight of the species.
#       +pos_dim (int) = number of components of position
#       +vel_dim(int) = number of components of the velocity
#	+mesh_values (Particles_In_Mesh) = object to store anything related with the particles in the mesh.
#	+part_values (Particles) = oject to store anything related to the actual particles in physical space.
#Notes:
#       +__init__() also receives nPoints from mesh
