#Methods:
#       +initialConfiguration(Species, [Field]) = Make necessary adjustment to the initial configuration of species so as to begin the advancement in time.
#	+advance(Species, [Field]) = Advance the particles in time. It will treat the particles as well as update the mesh_values.
#	+updateMeshValues(Species) = Update the attributes of Particles_In_Mesh.
#       +updateParticles(Species, [Field]) = Particle advance in time.

#Leap_Frog(Inherits from Motion_Solver):
#
#Definition = Implementation of Leap_Frog method. This method, as being more specific, is more dependant on the current situation of each simulation. As such it has to
#               be updated or new classes has to be created if the situation varies.
#
#Attributes: 
#	+type (string) = "Leap Frog"
#       +pic (PIC) = PIC solver. For this class specific methods not provided by PIC super class are used.
#Methods:
#       +initialConfiguration(Species, Field) = Make necessary adjustment to the initial configuration of species so as to begin the advancement in time.
#           it also takes care of the first update of Particle values in mesh. So far just E, so [Field]->Field.
#       +rewindVelocity(species, field) = Take the velocity of particles half a step back in time for 'field' electric field.
#       +updateParticles(Species, Field) = Particle advance in time. So far only E, so [Field]->Field in argument.
