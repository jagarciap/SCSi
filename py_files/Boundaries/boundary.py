#Definition = Class that shows the methods and attributes needed for each particular boundary arrangement.

#Methods:
#	+applyElectricBoundary(Electric_Field) = Applies the boundary condition to the electric field passed as argument.
#	+applyMagneticBoundary(Magnetic_Field) = Applies the boundary condition to the magnetic field passed as argument.
#	+applyParticleBoundary(Species) = Applies the boundary condition to the species passed as argument.

#       +removeParticles(Species species, [ind] ind) = Removes the particles from species stored at 'ind' positions.
#       +sampleIsotropicVelocity(double vth, int num) = It receives the most probable speed vth = \sqrt{2kT/m} and creates num random 2D velocities with their magnitudes following a Maxwellian distribution.
