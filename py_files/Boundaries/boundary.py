#Boundary (Abstract-like: will also have common methods that can be used by sub-classes. In composition with mesh):
#
#Definition = Class that shows the methods and attributes needed for each particular boundary arrangement.
#Attributes:
#	+type (string) = string indicating the type of boundary. It will be of the form "[Inner or Outer] - [Sorce, e.g. Spacecraft, Component, etc.]".
#	+location ([int]) = array containing the indices of the nodes that the boundary represents.
#Methods:
#	+applyElectricBoundary(Electric_Field) = Applies the boundary condition to the electric field passed as argument.
#	+applyMagneticBoundary(Magnetic_Field) = Applies the boundary condition to the magnetic field passed as argument.
#	+applyParticleBoundary(Species) = Applies the boundary condition to the species passed as argument.

#       +Function that inject particles into the domain.
#       +Parameters: 
#       +location ([ind]) = Nodes indicating the faces where the particles are going to be inserted. Each node represents the volume surrounded it. Location should be ordered increasingly.
#       +pic (PIC) = Instance of PIC for calculations. It also constains mesh, which is used in the function.
#       +species (Species) = Species to be inserted. It contains inside Particles_In_Mesh 'residuals' which is for each node the values of remnants from the insertion at the previous step.
#       +delta_n ([double]) = For each node in location, the density that is going to be inserted at this timestep. The array is ordered with the order of the nodes in mesh.
#       +n_vel ([double,double]) = For each node in location, the thermal velocity (for a the MB distribution) that the inserted particles will represent. Same order as delta_n.
